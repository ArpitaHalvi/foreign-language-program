          &quot;Bienvenue! we&apos;re thrilled to have you here. Embark on an

          French is spoken in many countries- not just in France! It is the
          official language in Switzerland, Belgium, Canada, Seychelles,
          Morocco, Ivory Coast- just to name a few. In fact, it is the only
          language spoken on all five continents. French people are very proud
          of their language and will immediately warm to you if you speak it-
          even if you make a few mistakes. Since there are no hard consonants in
          the French language, it is easy on the ear. It is a language of
          precision and musicality.
        </p>
        <p>
          We aim to teach you how to read, write and speak French. This
          international language will open up a host of opportunities for
          students and learners alike. The tourism, hotel and other hospitality
          industry, airlines, international banks, technical and artistic
          collaborations and teaching are some of the areas where knowledge of
          the French language and culture can help you. Other than that one can
          enjoy French literature and cinema, understand research papers in
          Mathematics and allied subjects.
