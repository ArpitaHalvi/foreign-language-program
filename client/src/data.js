    text: "I began taking French classes about a year ago , and I can honestly say it has been an incredibly rewarding experience. Initially, I was a bit intimidated by the language, especially with its complex grammar. However with time I'm loving this language. Ma'am Sonal was highly engaging, always finding creative ways to make the lessons both fun and educational. I must say she is very patient with each student.Through a combination of speaking practice, listening exercises, and vocabulary-building activities, I began to feel more confident in my abilities. These classes have not only given me the tools to communicate in French, but they’ve also deepened my appreciation for the culture and the history behind the language. I would highly recommend taking French classes to anyone who’s interested in learning a new language or broadening their cultural horizons through the best Ma'am Sonal. ",
