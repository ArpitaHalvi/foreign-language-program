JSON WEB TOKEN (JWT) - 
It is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.
It is often used for authentication and authorization in web applications.
1. Authentication - Verifying an identity of a user or client.
2. Authorization - Determining what actions a user or client is allowed to perform.

Components of JWT - 
1. Header - Contains metadata about the token, such as the type of a token and the signing algorithm being used.
2. Payload - Contains claims or statements about an entity(typically, the user) and additional data. Common claims include user ID, username, expiration time.
3. Signature - To verify that the sender of the JWT is who it is and to ensure that the message wasn't changed along the way, a signature is included.

Tokens such as JWT(JSON Web Token), are typically not stored in the database along with the other user detaails, Instead, they are issued during the authentication process and then stored on the client-side (e.g., in cookies or local storage) for later use.
